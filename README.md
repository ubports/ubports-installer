## Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting information can be found [in the docs](https://docs.ubports.com/en/latest/userguide/install.html). If you need help, you can join UBports' support channels on [telegram](https://t.me/WelcomePlus) or [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!KwdniMNeTmClpgHkND:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=ubports.chat&via=disroot.org) or ask a question [in the forum](https://forums.ubports.com/) or on [askubuntu](https://askubuntu.com). If you believe that the UBports Installer is not working correctly, you can also [file a new issue](https://github.com/ubports/ubports-installer/issues/new) to help us solve the problem. As a last resort, we also have [manual installation instructions for every device](https://devices.ubuntu-touch.io), that you can follow if you want to install without using the UBports Installer.

## Config files

By default, the Installer will always use the latest version of the [installation configuration files](https://github.com/ubports/installer-configs) available. Should you want to specify a custom config file, you can do that by starting the Installer with the `-f ./path/to/config.json` argument. This can be used to test changes to the configuration or even to add new devices to the installer. The [structure of the config files is specified here](https://github.com/ubports/installer-configs/blob/master/v1/_device.schema.json).

## Logs

If the installer runs into an error, it will usually present you with the option to create a bug report. It is always a good idea to make use of that feature, because that way the developers will almost always have all the information they need to help you. If you still have to look at the log file for some reason, you can find it in `~/.cache/ubports/ubports-installer.log` on linux (or `~/snap/ubports-installer/current/.cache/ubports/ubports-installer.log` if you're using the snap package). On Windows, it will be located at `%APPDATA%\ubports\ubports-installer.log` and on macOS you can find it under `$HOME/Library/Caches/ubports/ubports-installer.log`.
